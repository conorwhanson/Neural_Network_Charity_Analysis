# Charity Funding Analysis using Neural Networks

### Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from over 34,000 charity organizations. Once this data was cleaned and organized, neural networks were built to predict if funding received through Alphabet Soup would be used effectively.

First the data was imported and preprocessed for machine learning. This included encoding object data types, dropping null values, and putting data into bins to allow maximum efficacy of the machine learning models. Next, the data was split into features and target arays, then split again into training and testing sets,and finally scaled to reduce data imbalance. Lastly, the neural networks were built, trained, and evaluated for accuracy and loss metrics.
